    2. Mine was one of the most memorable years of my life: from teaching English to freelance writing and entertainment work, I held many different jobs.

    2. I'm British, so I'll be writing from that perspective, but most of my advice and experiences apply to any nationality eligible for a Working Holiday visa (and now more countries than ever have joined the party).

## 1. About Working Holidays in Japan

1.
    1. In Japan, a working holiday is a visa classification that falls under the "Designated Acitivities" category.
    2. It allows you to live, travel, and work in Japan for a limited period of time, usually about a year, although it varies by country.
    3. Working holiday programs are bilateral agreements Japan enters into with individual countries, which means that if you're working in Japan, there's a Japanese counterpart working in your country too.

2.
    1. According to Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this kind of visa allows young people to enter Japan "primarily for the purpose of spending holidays while allowing them to engage in employment as an incidental activity of their holidays for the purpose of supplementing their travel funds."
    2. Thismeans the visa is specifically designed for you to work part-time or freelance, all while having the time of your life.

3.
    1. Even if you're interested in the visa just to have a holiday, there is no limit on the number of hours you can work per week—unlike, say, the student visa, which forbids you from doing more than twenty-eight hours during term time.
    2. On a standard working visa, you're restricted to a certain type of work (sich as teaching in public schools on the Instructor visa).
    3. By contrast, with a Working Holiday visa, you can do any kind of work as long as it's not at "businesses which may impact public morals" (e.g. host bars).
    4. Working holiday is one of the only visa types in which a foreigner can do "unskilled" labor in Japan, such as working at a café or factory.

4.
    1. Working holidays aren't new.
    2. The first country to enter into this bilateral agreement with Japan was Australia, in 1980, but many others have followed suit—Iceland and Chile joined in as recently as 2018.
    3. If you're a citizen of any of the following countries, you may be eligible to take a working holiday in Japan.

    1. Check the specific conditions of the Working Holiday visa with your Japanese embassy using the links above.
    2. Age limits in particular can vary depending on nationality, but the following are the normal eligibility requirements:
        1. Being between eighteen and thirty years old at the time of application.
        2. Able to prove you have sufficient funds in the bank to pay for your stay in Japan  (around $3,000, or $2,000 if you apply with a return plane ticket).
        3. Traveling without dependents, although married couples can apply together if they both meet the criteria.
        4. Being in good health. Some countries require you to submit health information or have insurance coverage. I didn't have to do this.
        5. You must "be of good character." This is vague, but if you don't have a criminal record, you're probably fine.

## 2. How to Apply for Working Holiday in Japan

1.
    1. Compared to other visas, the working holiday application process is relatively straightforward.
    2. I was living in the UK when I applied, which was convenient since applicants must apply from their own country.
    3. And although I was worried because I had worked in Japan before and thought it might negatively impact my application, it never came up.

2.
    1. The first step was to gather my documents and head to my nearest consulate—in my case, the Embassy of Japan in London.
    2. I brought the following:

        * Passport
        * CV
        * Passport photo for the application
        * Completed application form, which can be downloaded fromm your embassy's website
        * "Outline of Intended Acitivites." This was my itinerary: where I planned to travel, what I planned to do, etc.
        * "Written Reason for Applying," typed on A4 paper. These were my intentions and reasons for wanting to spend a year in Japan.
        * Three months of bank statements showing I had the necessary funds (in pounds, in my case).
        * Return plane ticket. (Because I had this, the amount of funds I had to prove I had was lower.)
    
3.
    1. Be aware that you need photo ID to enter the embassy and that your bags will be checked for dangerous objects.
    2. Once inside, I took a ticket and waited for my number to be called.
    3. I brought my documents to the counter where they were inspected by a staff member.
    4. When the embassy was satisfied everything was in order, a cheerful man took everything (including my passport), gave me my application receipt, and told me to come back in ten days.
    5. Another pluys for the Working Holiday visa is that it's issued quickly—waiting times are usually between one and two weeks.

4.
    1. I made sure not to lose my application receipt and came back in ten days.
    2. I was accepted!
    3. It was spring, and I celebrated by buying some takeaway sushi and heading to the park opposite of the embassy, where I enjoyed it with a little rare British sunshine!

## 3. Tips for Getting Your Application Accepted

1.
    1. The good news is that *almost everyone who applies for a Working Holiday visa for Japan gets accepted if they meet the eligibility criteria*.
    2. I wanted to book my return flight before applying so I could show evidence of the spent funds, but I was nervous of doing so in case my application was rejected.
    3. Talking to other people who had been through the process made me feel more confident, however, as did reading stories online.
    4. Although there is very little cause for concern, it's still wise to do everything you can to ensure your application gets accepted.

    1. I'm not an immigration lawyer, but I've picked up a few tips from people who've been through the process.
